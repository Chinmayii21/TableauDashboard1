Tourism Company Sales Data
Sales dataset of tourism company for a year. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

•	Total observations(raw data) : 4823

•	After cleaning the data : 4655

•	We need to increase the buying percentage of customers in order to gain the profit.

•	For achieving this goal, we should understand the sales of packages according to incoming customers and design the marketing strategies accordingly to achieve success.

•	We analyse the data and present it as follows:

•	1) Productwise bookings based on occupation and income range : It will help us analyse which section of people prefer deluxe packages and we can concentrate on increasing these numbers by providing discounts to 
these segment of people or offer some subscription plans to them.

•	2) Marital status and no. of trips(f=gives number of repeating customers) , we can find the target area of customers who are buying frequently from us and provide them more benefits to increase sales.(for eg. If the married people are more, we can offer special plans for couples or groups).

•	3) Income level Vs bookings : It will help us know the average income range of our regular customers.

•	4) Genderwise bookings : We can plan the trips/tours according to the gender to increase their comfort.(we can offer or mention special safety care to be taken for female customers or arrange some extra complementary items for male customers accordingly). 

•	5) Agegroupwise bookings: It will let us know the most frequent age group of customers buying our package.We can plan the location of the tours according to their preferences.

•	6) City tiers Vs bookings : It will give us how the bookings vary among different regions(tier 1,2, and 3 cities respectively).We can market our product regionwise to increase the sales.

According to the needs, we remove the unnecessary columns from the data(data manipulation).
We then , visualize the data using Tableau Public and interpret the following results.




Insights :
1)	We can observe that total number of customers is 4888 while only 920 of them have purchased the tour package.Hence, the customer acquisition percent is merely 19% .
2)	In  the agewise bookings barplot , we can see that most of the customers come from the age range of 20-40 . Hence ,  we can plan the destinations accordingly for the young minds, rather than following the old trends.
3)	In the genderwise distribution, we can see that the number of males opting for the tour packages is more as compared to the female count.Here we can provide extra complementary items for the male customers in order to increase their engagement.Also , we can offer some extra safety plans or arrangements for increasing the female population.
4)	According to the marital status , we can observe that the single men and women tend to travel/book more tour packages than the married segment.We can provide discounts for the groups and repeating regular customers so they will tend to buy more from us.
